        #                  field names. Only those fields will be returned.
        #                  (Called :fields in calls to Collection#find.)
        #
        # number_to_skip :: Number of records to skip before returning
        #                   records. (Called :offset in calls to
        #                   Collection#find.) Default is 0.

        #             results will be ordered by that field in ascending
        #             order. If an array, it should be an array of field names

        #             it may be either a regular Hash or an OrderedHash. The
        #             keys should be field names, and the values should be 1
        #             (ascending) or -1 (descending). Note that if it is a
        #             regular Hash then sorting by more than one field
        #             probably will not be what you intend because key order
