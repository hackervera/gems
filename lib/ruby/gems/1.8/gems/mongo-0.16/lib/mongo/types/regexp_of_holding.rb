module Mongo

  # A Regexp that can hold on to extra options and ignore them. Mongo
  # regexes may contain option characters beyond 'i', 'm', and 'x'. (Note
  # that Mongo only uses those three, but that regexes coming from other
  # languages may store different option characters.)
  #
  # Note that you do not have to use this class at all if you wish to
  # store regular expressions in Mongo. The Mongo and Ruby regex option
  # flags are the same. Storing regexes is discouraged, in any case.
  class RegexpOfHolding < Regexp

    attr_accessor :extra_options_str

    # +str+ and +options+ are the same as Regexp. +extra_options_str+
    # contains all the other flags that were in Mongo but we do not use or
    # understand.

      super(str, options)
