0.7.2 March, 2009 support for base64 encrypted attributes in ActiveCrypto
(Micah Wedemeyer)
</p>
<p>
0.7 September 12th, 2006 PKYP services support
</p>
<p>
Marking the release of <a href="http://pkyp.org">pkyp.org</a> a new no
nonsense Public Key directory, this allows you register your public keys
and certificates on a public server. If you have web applications with
certificates or public keys you can point your users at <a
href="http://pkyp.org/{key.digest">pkyp.org/{key.digest</a>} for more info
about a certificate.
</p>
<p>
Register a public key or certificate at PKYP with the new method
register_with_pkyp like this:
</p>
<pre>
    signer=EzCrypto::Signer.generate
    signer.verifier.register_with_pkyp
</pre>
<p>
If you have the public key or certificate digest you can fetch the full
public key or certificate like this:
</p>
<pre>
    verifier=EzCrypto::Verifier.from_pkyp &quot;e93e18114cbefaaa89fda908b09df63d3662879a&quot;
    verifier.verify sig, request_text
</pre>
<p>
This allows a simpler way of transfering certificates. The idea of
including certificates with every request is not really necessary in an
online world. For example you could pass the digest in a HTTP header for a
REST web services request.
</p>
<p>
0.6.2 August 15th, 2006 Trust something release
</p>
<p>
Now comes complete with a fairly trusted list of root certs as extracted
from Apple&#8216;s keystore. With the addition of CACerts and GoDaddy SSL
Certs (Buy from <a href="http://widecert.net">widecert.net</a>). If you
feel any important ones are missing let me know.
</p>
<p>
You can create a trust store from this with TrustStore.default_trusted.
Note many of these CA&#8216;s are useless and you shouldn&#8216;t really
trust them, but this makes it easy to emulate the browsers support.
</p>
<p>
0.6.1 August 14th, 2006 Subject!=Issuer bug fix
</p>
<p>
I discovered a not so little bug in the certificate handling. The issuer
method of the Certificate mistakenly returned the subject.
</p>
<p>
0.6 August 10th, 2006 Certified PKI release
</p>
<p>
Finally I have had a good reason <a
href="http://www.tractis.com">www.tractis.com</a> to add Digital Signature
support to EzCrypto. We have support for RSA and DSA private and public
keys as well as basic X509 certificate support. All in typical EzCrypto
simple Ruby like methods.
</p>
<p>
KNOWN PROBLEM. The DSA Signer.public_key method has some sort of problem
but will be fixed for 0.6.1.
</p>
<p>
0.5 July 19th, 2006 Good citizen release
</p>
<p>
I have cleaned up the ActiveCrypto namespaces. It now does not use
ActiveRecord::Crypto, but ActiveCrypto::*, if you have called stuff
directly please update your code.
</p>
<p>
The reason for this is to really be a good citizen in the world of rails
and not unnecessarily pollute the ActiveRecord name space.
</p>
<p>
I have also created much more thorough unit tests and refactored some
things that did not work in version 0.4 that the world thankfully did not
see.
</p>
<p>
0.4 Flawed internal release
</p>
<p>
0.3 February 25th, 2006 new encrypted file support by Dirk
(dirk.barnikel@gmx.de) Thanks Dirk.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added test case for the file-related stuff. file-stuff seems to work fine

</li>
<li>Replaced hard coded IO buffersize (512) with class attribute Key#block_size
and default value.

</li>
<li>Modification to create {De,En}crypters only via the factory methods
Key#{de,en}crypter.

</li>
<li>Added Key#{de,en}crypt_file methods that take a file and de- or encrypts
it.

</li>
<li>The methods are implemented to call the cipher with small chunks of data
(512 bytes) to keep memory usage low.

</li>
<li>By default, the original file is first overwritten and then removed.

</li>
<li>This overwrite is not really safe but should make it harder to restore the
data of the removed file from the filesystem.

</li>
<li>Added Key#{store,load} methods that read and write Key data to/from files.

</li>
<li>Added Key#safe_{create,delete,read} methods to encapsulate the handling of
files inside EzCrypto.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
0.2.2 January 4th, 2006 Bug fixes and unit tests for active_crypto
</p>
<p>
There were some serious problems with ActiveCrypto&#8216;s support for
having keys in associated classes. I also added unit tests to
active_crypto. The support code was brutaly stolen from Rick Olson&#8216;s
acts_as_paranoid library. Unfortunately I disabled the schema stuff for
now, but will add it in the next release, which hopefully is soon.
</p>
<p>
0.2.1 November 2nd, 2005 New method in KeyHolder
</p>
<p>
Added set_encoded_key(enc) to KeyHolder for setting a key with the Base64
encoded keyvalue.
</p>
<p>
0.2 October 30th, 2005 Ruby on Rails integration
</p>
<p>
As promised I have now included my first version of ActiveCrypto the crypto
layer for ActiveRecord and Ruby on Rails.
</p>
<p>
0.1.1 August 27, 2005 Minor fixes
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Jason Vasquez mugatu at mugfu dot com for noticing that Key#to_s
called the nonexistent encoded method.
</p>
<p>
I also made a few slight changes to the documentation.
