- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Query the database.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The <tt>selector</tt> argument is a prototype document that all results must match. For example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: collection.find({&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;world&quot;})
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: only matches documents that have a key &quot;hello&quot; with value &quot;world&quot;. Matches can have other keys *in addition* to &quot;hello&quot;.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If given an optional block <tt>find</tt> will yield a Cursor to that block, close the cursor, and then return nil. This guarantees that partially evaluated cursors will be closed. If given no block <tt>find</tt> returns a cursor.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":selector :"
    body: A document (hash) specifying elements which must be present for a document to be included in the result set.
  type: :NOTE
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Options:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":fields :"
    body: Array of field names that should be returned in the result set (&quot;_id&quot; will always be included). By limiting results to a certain subset of fields you can cut down on network traffic and decoding time.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":skip :"
    body: Number of documents to omit (from the start of the result set) when returning the results
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":limit :"
    body: Maximum number of records to return
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":sort :"
    body: An array of [key, direction] pairs to sort by. Direction should be specified as Mongo::ASCENDING (or :ascending / :asc) or Mongo::DESCENDING (or :descending / :desc)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":hint :"
    body: "See #hint. This option overrides the collection-wide value."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":snapshot :"
    body: If true, snapshot mode will be used for this query. Snapshot mode assures no duplicates are returned, or objects missed, which were preset at both the start and end of the query's execution. For details see http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/How+to+do+Snapshotting+in+the+Mongo+Database
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: ":timeout :"
    body: "When <tt>true</tt> (default), the returned cursor will be subject to the normal cursor timeout behavior of the mongod process. When <tt>false</tt>, the returned cursor will never timeout. Note that disabling timeout will only work when #find is invoked with a block. This is to prevent any inadvertant failure to close the cursor, as the cursor is explicitly closed when block code finishes."
