- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Iterate over each object, yielding it to the given block. At most @num_to_return records are returned (or all of them, if @num_to_return is 0).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If #to_a has already been called then this method uses the array that we store internally. In that case, #each can be called multiple times because it re-uses that array."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "You can call #each after calling #to_a (multiple times even, because it will use the internally-stored array), but you can't call #to_a after calling #each unless you also called it before calling #each. If you try to do that, an error will be raised."
